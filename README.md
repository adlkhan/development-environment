These are my personal dotfiles that I have configured for my development environment. Dotfiles in this directory should be symlinked to home directory.

Symlink example

```
$ ln -s ~/code/dotfiles/gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
```

> Note: Not all files can be symlinked. For example, path to iTerm folder needs to be provided by opening settings of iTerm.
